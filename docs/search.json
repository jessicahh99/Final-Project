    "text": "2.1 Data\nIn order to address the question, we needed all the shots, missed shots, blocked shots, etc for the 2020-2021 until the 2023-2024 season. The source of the data for this project was through HockeyR. They collect the play-by-play data for each season including more than 100 variables for each play. To pull the data, we used the library() and load_pbp() functions, the latter of which is a function within the HockeyR package.\nCode\n#library(hockeyR)\n#pbp_2021 &lt;- load_pbp(\"2020-2021\")\nNote that HockeyR doesn’t have the 2024-2025 season data, and that the 2020-2021 season only had 56 games instead of the regular 82 due to COVID-19. As a note from the author of HockeyR, during the 2023-2024 season, the NHL implemented a new API, and deactivated the old one. This disrupted some of the formulas within HockeyR, although the 2023-2024 data appears to be fine. However, the data is supposed to be updated daily, and there’s no data for the 2024-2025 season.\nThrough the HockeyR package, the data is scraped from Hockey Reference (hockeyreference.com), and by using load_pbp(x), that’s a bulk download for the xth season. Once this function is run, that season’s play-by-play is now in your environment.",

Each row represents one play, for example, period start, faceoff, and hit are the first three plays in the 2023-2024 NHL season. Since this data is already tidy, there’s not many changes to make.\nIf we wanted to look at shot data alone, we can define a list of shot-related plays. For example, we can define Fenwick to be all goals, shots, missed shots, and blocked shots (maybe a citation?).\nCode\nfenwick &lt;- c(\"SHOT\", \"MISSED_SHOT\", \"BLOCKED_SHOT\", \"GOAL\")\nNext, we would filter the event type to only be those within fenwick. Now we have all the plays that are shot types. If I wanted individual player information, I could filter out for that specific player based on event_player_1_name.",
